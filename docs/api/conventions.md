# API conventions

This page documents the **paging contract** implemented in
[US-29-03 (#373)](https://github.com/hugiFreezy0815/TrackMyWealth/issues/373).
The other conventions (resource naming, errors, concurrency, decimals, dates, uploads and
authentication) belong to [US-29-01 (#371)](https://github.com/hugiFreezy0815/TrackMyWealth/issues/371),
which will extend this page. Until then, the committed [OpenAPI contract](../../api/openapi.yaml)
and [development standards](../architecture/development-standards.md) are the reference for those
topics. Do not infer rules for other endpoints from this section.

## Paging

### Which collections are paged?

Large collections expose `page`, `size` and `sort` query parameters and return the same
`PageResponse<T>` envelope. Small bounded collections, such as the account and portfolio lists,
return an ordinary JSON array; they do not accept this pagination contract. The committed OpenAPI
contract identifies which operation is paged and defines its response schema.

The server owns the envelope rather than serializing Spring Data's `Page`. An empty first page is:

```json
{
  "content": [],
  "page": {
    "number": 0,
    "size": 50,
    "totalElements": 0,
    "totalPages": 0
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `content` | Items on this page, in the requested order |
| `page.number` | Zero-based page number requested |
| `page.size` | Effective page size, **not** the number of items in `content` |
| `page.totalElements` | Total matching items visible to the caller, before paging |
| `page.totalPages` | Total number of pages at the effective size |

For example, given 120 matching transactions, `?page=1&size=50` returns the second set of
up to 50 rows and `page: { "number": 1, "size": 50, "totalElements": 120, "totalPages": 3 }`.
An out-of-range page returns an empty `content` with the requested `page.number` and the
unchanged totals. Totals only include data the caller may access.

### Page and size parameters

| Parameter | Accepted values | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | A whole number at least `0` | `0`; pages are **zero-based** |
| `size` | A whole number at least `1` | `50`; values above `200` are **capped at 200** |
| `sort` | See the per-operation whitelist below | Operation-specific default; repeatable |

A blank `page=` or `size=` is treated as absent. Sending `page` or `size` more than once,
or sending a negative, non-numeric or otherwise invalid value, returns HTTP 400 with
`code: "VALIDATION_FAILED"` in the standard problem response. A large valid size is capped,
not rejected: `?size=1000` applies a size of `200`, which is also reflected in `page.size`.

For example:

```http
GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}/transactions?page=1&size=50&sort=bookingDate,desc
```

### Sorting

Each paged endpoint declares a whitelist of **response field names**. Use `sort=<field>`,
`sort=<field>,asc` or `sort=<field>,desc`, with lower-case direction and no extra spaces.
Omitting the direction means ascending; omitting `sort` entirely uses the endpoint default.
Multiple `sort` parameters are allowed and applied in request order, but each field may appear
only once. The field names and spellings must match the published OpenAPI `sort` parameter enum.

| Paged operation | Allowed `sort` fields | Default | Unique tie-breaker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}/transactions` | `bookingDate`, `amount` | `bookingDate,desc` | `id` |
| `GET /api/v1/transactions` | `bookingDate`, `amount` | `bookingDate,desc` | `id` |
| `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}/imports` | `uploadedAt` | `uploadedAt,desc` | `id` |
| `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}/imports/{batchId}/rows` | `rowNumber` | `rowNumber,asc` | `rowNumber` |
| `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}/reconciliations` | `createdAt` | `createdAt,desc` | `id` |
| `GET /api/v1/institutions/catalogue` | `name` | `name,asc` | `id` |

`bookingDate` sorts first by booking date and then by creation time before the final `id`
tie-breaker. `amount` sorts by the transaction's value in the **account currency**, not
necessarily the original booking currency. The server always ends the effective order with
a unique tie-breaker, so equal visible sort values have a deterministic order. The tie-breaker
follows the direction of the first requested sort field unless it is itself the sortable field
(`rowNumber` for import rows). Clients do not specify or override that tie-breaker.

An unknown field (including an entity property not present in the response whitelist), duplicate
field, malformed direction or otherwise malformed `sort` returns HTTP 400 with
`code: "INVALID_SORT"`; it is **not silently ignored**. The problem `detail` names the allowed
fields. Clients should handle the stable `code`, not parse the human-readable `detail`.

### Offset paging and refresh after imports

**Offset paging is the final contract; there are no cursors.** The page offset is
`page * page.size`. With an unchanged set of matching rows and a fixed sort, the server's unique
tie-breakers make page boundaries deterministic. They cannot prevent rows from moving between
offsets when data is inserted, deleted, or updated between requests.

**When an import adds rows while the user is scrolling a paged list, the client must discard its
loaded pages and reload from page 0.** Do not append the next offset page to the previously loaded
items after such a change: that can duplicate rows or skip them. The same page-0 reset applies
when the user changes filters or sort order, or performs another action known to change the
matching result set. Preserve the chosen filters and sort when restarting. If a request fails,
keep the error visible and allow a retry; do not silently advance to another page.

The client may use `page.totalElements` and `page.totalPages` for navigation, but should treat
them as a snapshot of the individual response, not a promise that subsequent pages will have the
same totals. This is why the refresh rule above is necessary.

### Verification and implementation references

- `backend/src/main/java/com/trackmywealth/backend/dto/PageResponse.java` owns the response.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/trackmywealth/backend/dto/PagingValues.java` owns size limits.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/trackmywealth/backend/web/Paged.java` and
  `PagedArgumentResolver.java` define and enforce page, size and sort parsing.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/trackmywealth/backend/web/SortWhitelist.java` enforces
  the per-endpoint fields and deterministic order.
- `PagingIntegrationTest`, `PagedArgumentResolverTest`, `SortWhitelistTest` and
  `ApiConventionsIntegrationTest` test the behavior and the published schema.

The backend's ArchUnit rules reject `Page` or `Slice` return values in controllers and require
every controller `Pageable` or `Sort` argument to have `@Paged`. When introducing a new paged
endpoint, declare its whitelist, default sort and tie-breaker, update its OpenAPI contract and
generated app types, and update this table in the same change.
